- **Photoresistor version**: Using a photoresistor, it basically shows a scary image and sound when the light is out, and goes back to normal when the light is back.
- **Ultrasonic sensor version**: Has the same effect of the photoresistor version, but activates scary mode when something is closer than a specific distance, and goes back to normal when there is nothing close to the ultrasonic sensor.
- **Photoresistor and ultrasonic sensor together**: Uses both a photoresistor and an ultrasonic sensor. When the light is out, it activates scary mode, but if the light is on, it starts checking the ultrasonic sensor to check if something is too close.
